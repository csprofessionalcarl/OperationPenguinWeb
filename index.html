    <h1>Updates</h1>
   <ul>
     <li>5/3/2016  A whole lot of work has been done since the last update. The website work had been put on hold while we finished up
     our presentations. Marathon and Racing Modes are Functional save the Pause Button and Race Finisher. Asteroids Mode is semi-functional
     with a boss appearing, however there are no ways to defeat him at the moment. Customization menu is fully functional. At the moment the
     ship is too small to see your penguin piloting it, so until we find a fix you will only be able to see the ship.</h3>
     <li>4/5/2016  Made the Website button functional, and made the asset pictures smaller. That way they don't take eons to load</h3>
     <li>4/4/2016  Hosted the website so anybody with the link would have access to it</h3>
     <li>4/3/2016  Pooled all of our separate parts together to create a working alpha demo app for presentation purposes</li>
     <li>4/2/2016  Our Focus group session was today. We recieved a lot of great feedback to keep improving the game</li>
     <li>4/1/2016  Deleted all the files and started over. To make a game about Polar Bears</li>
     <li>3/29/2016 We've drawn several more penguins, including the ever elusive doot doot penguin.</li>
     <li>3/28/2016 Finished all of the colors for the MACH1 spaceship
     <li>3/25/2016 This is where we will be posting any major news or updates to the game. Look forward to seeing important new</li>
