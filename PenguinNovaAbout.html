      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>In the distant galaxy Superio Galagactus Opera 8 a species not unlike the modern penguins we know of today have evolved to the next level. Using their advance technology they created ships capable of high speed travel. Setting the standard in space travel the penguin race "Pengoo" have spread their influence throughout the galaxy. Every 300000 miliseconds the old King is overthrown, and the Pengoo's must decide a New King. Race your way to the top and become the King the Pengoos need for about 5 minutes. Take your spot amongst the most legendary of Pengoo Kings. </p>

      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <p>I see you've found yourself here to learn how to operate the advance technology of the Pengoo. I get it, their technology is far too advance to wrap your head around. Luckily they were gracious enough to imprsion me and force me to write this guide in order to instruct the common human how to fly their ships.</p>

      <h3>How to Steer:</h3>
      <p>Steering for the Pengoos has proven to be a difficult challenge to overcome. It took the Pengoos years before they discovered a layout that would make it easy for them. Instead of a wheel the Pengoos use advance button technology. One button yaws them left. The other button yaws them right. This technology has puzzled their rivals the Bearis and the Whalaroos for eons.</p>
