      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>In the distant galaxy Superio Galagactus Opera 8 a species not unlike the modern penguins we know of today have evolved to the next level. Using their advance technology they created ships capable of high speed travel. Setting the standard in space travel the penguin race "Pengoo" have spread their influence throughout the galaxy. Every 300000 miliseconds the old King is overthrown, and the Pengoo's must decide a New King. Race your way to the top and become the King the Pengoos need for about 5 minutes. Take your spot amongst the most legendary of Pengoo Kings. </p>

      <h1>How To Play</h1>
      <p>I see you've found yourself here to learn how to operate the advance technology of the Pengoo. I get it, their technology is far too advance to wrap your head around. Luckily they were gracious enough to imprsion me and force me to write this guide in order to instruct the common human how to fly their ships.</p>
        
      <h6>Help</h6>
        
      <h3>How to Steer:</h3>
      <p>Steering for the Pengoos has proven to be a difficult challenge to overcome. It took the Pengoos years before they discovered a layout that would make it easy for them. Instead of a wheel the Pengoos use advance button technology. One button yaws them left. The other button yaws them right. This technology has puzzled their rivals the Bearis and the Whalaroos for eons.</p>
        
        <h3>Racing Your Opponents:</h3>
        <p>There are a total of six racers per race, including yourself. Now I like you, so I modified your ship to be way faster than your opponents. It takes about seven seconds to pass another opponent. In these short races that's a guranteed win. Provided you don't crash and burn. When you become king maybe you could free me. You know I scratch your back, you release me from prison. Please?<p>
        
        <h3>Obstacles</h3>
        <p>Despite their cute appearences, Pengoos are horrible monsters. They frequently litter in space! Their little races and marathon challenges always leave ship parts and junk stuck in asteroid belts. They also throw their fish bones out of the cockpit window when they are done eating. No respect for the space environment! Pray you don't hit any of these with your ship. At the speed you're going you will crash for sure. So do your part for the environment and DON'T CRASH YOUR SHIP!<p>
        
        <h3>Making Friends</h3>
        <p>If you win enough races and complete enough challenges you might attract other Pengoos to race for you. The mechanic might even be able to give you a new paint job or new ship. Don't ask what the red paint is made of... Some of these racers have amazing abilities that might aid you in other events. If your really impressive you might even attract the attention of Super Sai Penguin. You and him would be unstoppable! Assuming he doesn't beat you up and just take your place as the new king.<p>
